Assigment Nr. 2

In your uploaded assignment the script language will be checked but you have to apply it in the excel workbook as well.

1.      In the New Balance column, write a function named n_balance, which will calculate the value of the new balance in column M using the formula New Balance = Previous Balance + Invoice Amount - Paid Amount.                       

2.      In the Sibling Discount column, write the function s_discount which will determine the 5% discount from the Previous Balance column for parents with 2 or more children. Information on children is entered in the Enroled column.

3.      Add a function to the Sibling Discount column so that you can determine the discount based on the number of children. If the number of children is more than 1, then a 3% discount is applied for each child. (2 children - 6%, 3 children - 9%, etc.) Maximum discount 15%.

4.      In the Helper Discount column, write the function h_discount, which determines the discount based on the number of hours worked for the school. Condition if the number of hours worked in the Helper Hours column is greater than 15 and the employee status in the Emp?  column Equal to TRUE is subject to an additional discount of 250USD.

5.      Correct the n_ balance function by adding the new calculation methodology. New Balance = Calculated fee- Sibling Discount - Helper Discount - Previous Balance + Paid Amount.
